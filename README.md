## Description

This repository contains my personal Neovim configuration, utilizing the excellent [nvchad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) framework. Neovim is a highly customizable text editor that enhances productivity and code development. With the nvchad configuration, I have fine-tuned Neovim to suit my specific workflow and preferences.

## Features

- A well-organized and efficient configuration that streamlines my Neovim experience.
- Pre-configured plugins through the nvchad framework, providing powerful functionality out-of-the-box.
- Optimized key mappings and shortcuts to boost productivity and reduce repetitive tasks.
- Syntax highlighting and auto-completion for a wide range of programming languages and file types.
- A minimalistic and visually appealing theme for a pleasant editing environment.

## Installation

To use my Neovim configuration, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Neovim installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/AnimeshTalukdar/Neovim-config-using-nvchad.git ~/.config/nvim

```




3. Install the required plugins by opening Neovim and running the following command:

## Usage

My Neovim configuration is designed to be intuitive and ready for immediate use. Here are some key features and customizations:

- File Explorer: Use `<leader>e` to open the file explorer and navigate through your project files easily.
- Code Navigation: Employ the Language Server Protocol (LSP) and fuzzy searching to find symbols, definitions, and references in your code.
- Code Formatting: Automatically format code using `<leader>fm` for a clean and consistent codebase.
- Custom Shortcuts: A set of custom shortcuts tailored to speed up editing tasks and improving efficiency.

## Customization

Feel free to modify my configuration according to your preferences. The `init.lua` file contains all the settings, key mappings, and plugin configurations. You can add or remove plugins, change key mappings, and customize the appearance to make it your own.

## Credits

I would like to give credit to the creators and maintainers of the nvchad framework for providing an excellent foundation for my Neovim configuration. The list of plugins and their authors are mentioned in the `init.lua` file.
